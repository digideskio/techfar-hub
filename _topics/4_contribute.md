The draft TechFAR Hub alpha was created during the winter of 2016 by the procurement team at the U.S. Digital Service. We will continue to maintain and update these resources as we learn what works best for the people we serve.

If you have case studies, tools, or other resources that you think should be on the site let us know. If you find anything on the site isn't working or is just unclear let us know that too. The easiest way is to create an issue on Github but if you would rather you can just send us an e-mail. **Help us make it better!**
